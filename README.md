## Introduction

The object of this project was to gain practice using the React library.  It is a basic book organization tool, where the user can search for books by topic, and add them to their personalized bookshelf by category:  Currently Reading, Want to Read, or Read. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) provided the static HTML, CSS, as well as a backend server with methods to access it. 

## Dependencies

All necessary dependencies are listed in the package.json file included in the repository, and can be installed using npm install.

## Using the App

The app can be started using npm start.  Once the browser window is open, the user can search for new books by navigating to the search page using the "+" icon, and can add them to their shelves or move them between shelves using each book's drop-down menu.  It is important to note that the list of books is limited in scope, and using only these [search terms](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) will produce results.  

## Try It Yourself

The starting code provided by Udacity is available on their [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).
